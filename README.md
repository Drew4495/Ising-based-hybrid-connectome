# Ising-based-hybrid-connectome
A procedure to embed functional MRI and structural connectivity from DWI into a single resting state structural connectome (rsSC). The resulting rsSC has the advantage of being able to reconstruct functional and structural connectivity to a high degree and having positive (excitatory) and negative (inhibitory) coefficients.
